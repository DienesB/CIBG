Sensitivity analysis of the Solar Energy on Building Envelopes (SEBE) model

This is an exemplary work to demonstrate the processing of solar irradiance data on a selected wall surface.
Identical steps are conducted on files representing low and a high spatial resolution.
Notable irradiance values are then visualized together for the two files.

Please note:
Solar irradiance data was produced by the Solar Energy on Building Envelopes (SEBE) model.
